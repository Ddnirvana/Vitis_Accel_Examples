host_global_5.0_shell
=====================

Host to global memory bandwidth test for 5.0 shell

This example tests the bandwidth of the interconnect between host and
global memory for 3 cases: \* host to global memory transfer, \* global
memory to host transfer, and \* bidirectional transfer

Host and device are connected via PCIe interconnect and latency of this
interconnect can be seen as the acceleration tax for the application.
Hence, these transfers should be efficiently managed.

Different combinations of buffer sizes and number of buffers are created
and data to be transferred is filled into buffers using
``clEnqueueFillBuffer`` API in which pattern with which buffers are to
be filled can be specified.

.. code:: cpp

   err = command_queue.enqueueFillBuffer<int>((cl::Buffer&)mems[i], i, 0, nxtcnt, 0, 0);

For bandwidth test, ``clenqueueMigrateMemObjects()`` API is used to
transfer the data from host to global memory and vice versa.

.. code:: cpp

   err = commands.enqueueMigrateMemObjects(mems1, 0/* 0 means from host*/);
   err = commands.enqueueMigrateMemObjects(mems2, CL_MIGRATE_MEM_OBJECT_HOST);

**Note :** From software emulation log it can be seen that for larger
number of buffers of small sizes , throughput achieved for transfer is
less whereas for small number of buffers with larger sizes, throughput
achieved for transfer is more.

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/kernel.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./host_global <krnl_host_global XCLBIN>
