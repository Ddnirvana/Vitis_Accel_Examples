Loop Fusion
===========

This example will demonstrate how to fuse two loops into one to improve
the performance of an OpenCL C/C++ Kernel.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Kernel Optimization, Loop Fusion, Loop Pipelining

**KEYWORDS:** #pragma HLS PIPELINE

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/nearest_neighbor.cpp
   src/nearest_neighbor_bad.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./loop_fusion <nearest_neighbor XCLBIN>
