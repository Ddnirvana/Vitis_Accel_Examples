Port Width Widening
===================

This example shows how HLS introduces the capability of resizing the
port width of the kernel interface ports for better resource utilization
maintaining the performance.

**KEY CONCEPTS:** Interface port width auto widening

**KEYWORDS:** m_axi_max_widen_bitwidth

This example introduces the capability of how Vitis HLS can configure
the size of kernel interface ports.

User can customize the interface ports size using ‘config_interface
-m_axi_max_widen_bitwidth size’ Following is the content of
hls_config.tcl file

.. code:: cpp

   config_interface -m_axi_max_widen_bitwidth 256

The interface size setting need to be specified in hls_config.tcl file.
We include this tcl file in our krnl_port_widen.ini file and by using
the ``--config`` tag in the kernel compile stage we specify the m_axi
interface size.

Following is the content of ini file

.. code:: cpp

DESIGN FILES
------------

Application code is located in the src directory. Accelerator binary
files will be compiled to the xclbin directory. The xclbin directory is
required by the Makefile and its contents will be filled during
compilation. A listing of all the files in this example is shown below

::

   src/host.cpp
   src/krnl_base.cpp
   src/krnl_widen.cpp

COMMAND LINE ARGUMENTS
----------------------

Once the environment has been configured, the application can be
executed by

::

   ./host <krnl_port_widen XCLBIN>
